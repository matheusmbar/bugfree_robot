Open source robotics code/blog of developping with TDD on embedded systems

I'm going to develop the firmware from scratch for a robotics project of mine. Reach my [website](http://matheusmbar.github.io/) for more details. It will be used as a progress log, describing technical stuff about how to put the test environment to work, create unitary and integration tests, make-build-test-repeat, design system's architecture and other times talking about the robot itself, its taks and the algorithms implemented for it.

The idea is giving a strong base for those who want to improve as embedded programmers through passing on some practices that are helping me improve in the last (and following) months too.
